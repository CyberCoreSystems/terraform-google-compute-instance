# Compute Engine VM (Shielded, private)

[![IaC Bazaar: live-tested](https://www.iac-bazaar.com/api/artifacts/gcp-compute-instance/badge)](https://www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/gcp-compute-instance?utm_source=syndication&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=artifact)

A hardened Compute Engine VM on Debian 12 with Shielded VM (Secure Boot, vTPM, integrity monitoring), OS Login for IAM-managed SSH, no external IP by default, and deletion protection on.

This module was **applied to a real Google Cloud account, verified, and destroyed** on 2026-06-30 - not just `terraform validate`d.

Check it yourself, no account needed:

```
curl -s https://www.iac-bazaar.com/api/artifacts/gcp-compute-instance/verification
```

The receipt names every check that ran, when it ran, and the SHA-256 of the
archive it describes. Full detail: [www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/gcp-compute-instance](https://www.iac-bazaar.com/catalog/gcp-compute-instance)

## Usage

```hcl
module "compute_instance" {
  source  = "registry.terraform.io/CyberCoreSystems/compute-instance/google"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  # See variables.tf for the full input contract.
}
```

## Why this module

Every module we publish goes through the same checks before release:

| check | what it means |
|---|---|
| `tofu validate` + `tflint` | it parses and lints clean |
| `checkov` | scanned for insecure defaults |
| **live test** | **really applied to a cloud account, outputs verified, then destroyed** |

That last row is the one most module catalogues skip. A module that has never
been applied has never been proven.

## Provider compatibility

```
google >= 7.0, < 8.0
```
